# Data Recording and Storage

### Connecting to the Raspberry Pi
1. Ensure both your iPhone and Raspberry Pi are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
2. Go to the app’s “Settings” page and set your Raspberry Pi’s IP address or hostname.

    - To find your Raspberry Pi's IP address, run `ifconfig` in your Raspberry Pi's terminal.
    - Run `hostname` to find its hostname.

### Recording Data
1. Navigate to the "Panel" page and tap “Record”.
2. Confirm that the Raspberry Pi connection status is “Connected.”
3. Choose the appropriate task scenario and provide a description.
4. Press “Start recording” to begin capturing data. Press the button again to stop.

### Viewing and Sharing Data
You can access saved data by navigating to the “MagiClaw” folder in the iPhone’s “Files” app.

### File Formats
- **`metadata.json`**: Contains all properties of the recorded data.

- **`AngleData.csv`**: Contains angle values from the encoder.

- **`R_ForceData.csv`**: Contains 6D force data from the <u>right-side</u> soft robotic finger, measurements in newtons (N) and newton-meters (Nm). Columns 2 to 7 represent the following values: Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz.

- **`L_ForceData.csv`**: Contains 6D force data from the <u>left-side</u> soft robotic finger, measurements in newtons (N) and newton-meters (Nm). Columns 2 to 7 represent the following values: Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz.

- **`PoseData.csv`**: Contains 6D pose data of the iPhone measured by ARKit. It's a 4x4 transformation matrix in original, stored column-wise.

- **`RGB.mp4`**: Rear camera recording, with a resolution of 640x480 pixels.

- **`Depth`**: Stored in `.bin` format within the Depth folder. Each file contains depth data for the corresponding frame, with a resolution of 256x192. The data type is UInt, and the depth values are in units of 10e-4 meters.

- **`Audio.m4a`**:  
  - Format: AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)
  - Sample Rate: 12kHz
  - Channels: Mono (1 channel)

### Timestamp
- Present in the first column of each CSV file, indicating the elapsed time since recording started, in seconds. For depth data, timestamps are included in the file names.

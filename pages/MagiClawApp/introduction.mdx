MagiClaw is an advanced tool designed for collecting, recording, and streaming sensor data from iOS devices, enabling seamless integration with external hardware and robots. 

It offers users the ability to:
* Capture 6D pose data from their iOS devices, providing comprehensive spatial tracking.
* Record video using the rear camera, ideal for documenting experiments or visual tasks.
* Record audio from the device's microphone to add context or analyze environmental sounds.
* Collect depth data via the LiDAR sensor for accurate environmental mapping and object detection.
* Monitor and record 6D force and torque data from the robot's gripper, facilitating precise control and feedback in manipulation tasks.
* Integrate other data from external hardware devices such as Raspberry Pi, allowing flexible and expandable setups.

MagiClaw app provides powerful features for data collection and manipulation with diverse robots, it is an ideal tool for researchers and robots developers.
